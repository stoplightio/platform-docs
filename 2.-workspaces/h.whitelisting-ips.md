# Integrate Behind the Firewall

Traffic from Stoplight originates through a fixed IP address. Network administrators may have to set up firewall rules (allowlist, permitlist) to allow access to Stoplight to access your Git provider and Auth instances.

Here's the IP address you need to add to your allowlist:

**35.226.194.249**
