# Creating a Stoplight workspace

A Stoplight **workspace** is a collaborative hub to organize and collaborate on all your API projects and assets. Within a workspace, you can promote standards, visibility, and reuse artifacts across your organization.

To create a workspace, you'll need to sign up for a Stoplight account using an email address from your company’s domain.

**Tip:** Stoplight recommends making a single workspace for your organization, and then using [roles and permissions](https://www.notion.so/Workspace-Roles-a0ed0e545fb840e7a0c7ec3ff2b3241f) to manage your workflows.

## Things to keep in mind:

- When you create a workspace, you’ll become the primary workspace owner.
- You can invite as many members to a workspace as your pricing plan allows.
- You can only create one workspace per email address.

## Creating your workspace

2. This will open up a signup form. Enter your work **email address** and a workspace **name** to  complete the URL.
